# nwg-drawer

This application is a part of the [nwg-shell](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell) project.

Application drawer for sway Wayland compositor, and a golang replacement to the `nwggrid` command (a part of
[nwg-launchers](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-launchers)).

Old features: application grid, pinned apps, search entry. New features: gtk-layer-shell support, filtering by categories, searching files in XDG user dirs.
